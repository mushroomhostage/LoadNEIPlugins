LoadNEIPlugins

This mod is a simple workaround to allow you to use Not Enough Items 1.3.0.1 plugins with SK's Launcher.

Add the mod in the launcher, and it will load the NEI plugins for Forestry, RailCraft, IC2
(from https://bitbucket.org/mistaqur/nei\_plugins/wiki/Home), 
and RedPower (from http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-125-smp-chickenbones-mods/).

Check the log beginning with "Loading NEI plugins" for details.
